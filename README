The saying goes, "A million monkeys at typewrites will eventually write
the complete works of Shakespeare." I wanted to see how long it would
take. So I wrote this little application that would try to randomly
generate a string. So far I can't even generate the string "Monkey" in
fewer than 5 million attempts. So I suppose the say might be correct,
but a lot of those monkeys are going to die trying too.

The usefulness of this code is nearly 0 but it gave me a chance to use
arc4random_uniform() which I always enjoy for some reason. As it stands
now, the application will not find any punctuation aside from spaces so
periods, commas, question marks, and exclamation points will cause the
application to hit the 5 million attempt limit and fail.

to compile:

make

to run:

./monkeys.out

I have already spelled monkeys, 'mokeys' twice so I expect there are
plenty of of spelling mistakes as well.
